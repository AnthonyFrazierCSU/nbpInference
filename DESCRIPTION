Title: nbpInference: Causal inference on matched datasets with continuous treatments
Version: 0.1
Author: Anthony Frazier
Maintainer: Anthony Frazier <anthony.frazier@colostate.edu>
Description: This package provides tools to conduct inference on the sample average
  treatment effect for a matched (observational) dataset with continuous-valued
  treatment. This package provides functions for calipered non-bipartite matching, 
  bias-corrected estimation of the sample average treatment effect and covariate-adjusted
  variance estimation.
